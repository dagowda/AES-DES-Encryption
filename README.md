# AES and DES Encryption 
This provides an overview of the implementation of AES and DES encryption algorithms in Python, along with a demonstration of their avalanche effect. The avalanche effect is a measure of the degree to which small changes in the input to an encryption algorithm result in significant changes in the output.
